      Welcome to the MWP Experiment! Press the SPACEBAR to begin.

      Today your job is to identify which picture (left or right) is oriented
      correctly in the normal, upright position. For example, you might see the
      two pictures below. They are exactly the same image, except that one of
      them is flipped 180 degrees so that it is upside down, and the other is
      not flipped. Your job is to pick the one that is *not flipped*, and press
      the key for that picture. If the upright picture is on the left, you will
      press the left arrow. If it's on the right, press the right arrow. Press
      the correct key for the images below to continue.

      Before you see the pictures, you will hear a word through the headphones.
      Please put the headphones on now. Press the SPACEBAR to hear a word,
      and then you will see two new pictures. Respond to the pictures
      using the arrow keys.
  4:
    tag: word
    top: >
      Sometimes the word you hear will not match the pictures you see, but your
      task is exactly the same: determine which picture is correctly oriented.
      On other trials instead of seeing pictures you will see a word printed
      either on the left or on the right. On these trials, you should respond
      whether or not the printed word is the same word that you heard through
      the headphones. If it matches, press the up arrow. If it does not match,
      press the down arrow. Press the SPACEBAR to see one of these trials.

      As you perform this task, please stare at the center of the screen
      directly at the "+" and respond based on what you see with your peripheral
      vision. On some trials you will see flashing colorful patterns as shown
      below. You will now start with some practice trials. If you have any
      questions about the task, ask the experimenter now. When you are ready
      to begin, press the SPACEBAR.
